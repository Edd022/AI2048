# AI 2048 - System Design

Welcome to the repository for AI 2048 of the Systems Sciences Foundations course at University
Distrital Francisco José de Caldas.in this **worshop_1** This project focuses on designing and programming an autonomous intelligent agent capable of playing the game 2048 using reinforcement learning and cybernetic principles.

# Project Objective

Design and document a self-adaptive agent that:
- Perceives the environment (2048 board state),
- Takes actions (move directions),
- Receives rewards based on game progress,
- Learns through feedback and adapts its behavior.


## System Design Documentation

You can find the full system design document for Workshop 1 here:

[Workshop 1 — System Design PDF](https://github.com/Edd022/AI2048/blob/main/Workshop_1/Workshop_1.pdf)

The document includes:
- Functional Specifications (Sensors, Actuators, Reward Function)
- Use Case Descriptions
- System Architecture Diagram
- Feedback Loop Explanation
- Implementation Strategy
